<p>Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.<br> An array is used to store a collection of data,<br> but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.<br></p>

<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99,<br> you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99]<br> to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.<br>

<p>All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations.<br> The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.<br>
<h4><u>Declaring Arrays</u></h4>
<p>To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows −
<br>
"type arrayName [ arraySize ];"<br>

<p>This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero<br> and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a<br> 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement −<br>

"double balance[10];"<br>
<p>Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.<br>
<h4><u>Initializing Arrays</h4></u>

<p>You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows −<br>

"double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};"<br>

<p>The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that<br> we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].<br>

<p>If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created.<br> Therefore, if you write −<br>

"double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};"<br>

<p>You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example.<br> Following is an example to assign a single element of the array −<br>

"balance[4] = 50.0;"

<p>The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0.<br> All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index<br> and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1.<br> Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above −<br>

<h4><u>Accessing Array Elements</h4></u>

<p>An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index<br> of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example −<br>

"double salary = balance[9];"<br>


<p>The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable.<br> The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned <br>concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays −<br>
